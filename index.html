                        I only speak one language, English. Australian born, but with Irish/British ancestors, although my family lineage has been in Australia for 
                        quite some time now. I dropped out of grade 10 and later pursued my education online through my hometown university, JCU. Upon completion of 
                        my course, which was a short course that I started due to COIVD-19, I started a bachelor’s degree in artificial intelligence with Deakin, but 
                        only completed 3 units and decided to change to the Bachelor of IT with RMIT. I’m a gamer, enjoy making art (even though I don’t do it as much lately), 
                        watch anime, and love my cat!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interest in IT started in grade school. When I was younger, I wanted nothing more than a dirt bike for Christmas, but I was gifted with a
                         laptop for Christmas. I thought to myself “this isn’t a dirt bike!”, but that’s when my true love of IT started. Through games I became
                          interested in modification, specifically Garry’s Mod, which as the name suggests is very open to modification. I struggled through broken 
                          forms of LUA coding, barely understanding anything because I didn’t look up any guides on how to use the language; I’d just haphazardly 
                          try things until something happened, ideally close to my goal.
                    </p> 
                    <p>During my studies with JCU and Deakin, I came to understand the basic principles of coding in HTML/CSS (although I don’t remember as much 
                        as I should), Java, Python, C++ and C#. Through my use of C++ and C#, I was also acquainted with the use of Git and Github. Unfortunately,
                         I require more time to do other things than just study, such as work, but I want to be able to finish a degree within a reasonable time 
                         frame, which is when I discovered the RMIT bachelor of IT. A friend of mine in a World of Warcraft guild that I raid with told me about 
                         her experience with RMIT and how she had found a job whilst still in the course; that she was studying full time but without having to do 
                         3-4 units a semester. I mulled it over and decided it was a good choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I expect to learn about group work, because although I enjoyed my previous study experience, I didn’t really learn anything about working 
                        in groups. I want to get a job lined up for when I graduate so that I can work in a field that I enjoy, but as for the field and section of IT, 
                        I’m unsure. I enjoy the coding aspect of IT, although I’m not very good at it.

                <h2>Overview (100 words) -</h2> 
                <p>The project will be a web and mobile based application that will compare the prices of grocery items, 
                    as compared to other stores, which will involve the use of a web scraper to collect all the links available. 
                    It will then scrape the data, aggregate, and clean the data. This cleaned data will then be used to identify what 
                    the item is with the use of the category and name, the price of the product and whether it is on sale or not, compare 
                    the price of similar products for stores around you, stock availability depending on store the data in some sort of database.	
                </p>

                <h2>Motivation (100) words) - </h2>
                <p>Everyone needs to buy things from the grocery store, but it is time consuming to find the best prices from every grocery store
                     competitor. If a consumer could be given the ability to search across multiple grocery stores to find the best prices and given 
                     a distance to the store, based off distance travel time data given from Google Directions API, this information would allow them to
                      make an informed decision and evaluate what is best for them, given possible advantages due to store times, rewards, distance, and 
                      price. Given that the processes of crawling, scraping, cleaning, and storing the data to be processed will take some tweaking to automate,
                       it is feasibly possible. 
                </p>

                <h2>Description (500 words) - </h2>
                <p>Detailed description of the features of the product or service </p>


                <h2>Tools and Technologies (100) words) -</h2> 
                <p>Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate. 
                </p>

                <h2>Skills Required (100 words) -</h2> 
                <p>For large scale deployment, it would require servers, in which would require proficiency in whatever server architecture used, be it the 
                    operating system, such as , tools or physical hardware, in the case you’re not using cloud servers. It could be required to use Python for
                     the web crawling, data scraping, and storage of the data. Depending on the type of database management system you use, it will be likely you
                      will need to understand PHP & SQL/MySQL for the database and the search engine required. HTTP/CSS will be required for the website, along 
                      with supporting languages, such as Java, the ability to use APIs and their associated languages, namely JavaScript. (NEED TO FINISH)

                <h2>Outcome (100 words) - </h2>
                <p>If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</p>
