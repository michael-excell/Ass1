                <h1>Basic information:</h1>
                <p>
                    I only speak one language, English. Australian born, but with Irish/British ancestors, although my family lineage has been in 
                    Australia for quite some time now. I dropped out of grade 10 and later pursued my education online through my hometown university,
                     JCU. Upon completion of my course, which was a short course that I started due to COVID-19, I started a bachelor’s degree in artificial 
                     intelligence with Deakin, but only completed 3 units and decided to change to the Bachelor of IT with RMIT. I’m a gamer, enjoy making art 
                     (even though I don’t do it as much lately), watch anime, and love my cat!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in IT started in grade school. When I was younger, I wanted nothing more than a dirt bike for Christmas, but I was gifted with 
                    a laptop for Christmas. I thought to myself “this isn’t a dirt bike!”, but that’s when my true love of IT started. Through games I became interested 
                    in modification, specifically Garry’s Mod, which as the name suggests is very open to modification. I struggled through broken forms of LUA coding, 
                    barely understanding anything because I didn’t look up any guides on how to use the language; I’d just haphazardly try things until something happened,
                     ideally close to my goal.  
                </p> 
                <p>
                    During my studies with JCU and Deakin, I came to understand the basic principles of coding in HTML/CSS (although I don’t remember as much as I should), 
                    Java, Python, C++ and C#. Through my use of C++ and C#, I was also acquainted with the use of Git and Github. Unfortunately, I require more time to do 
                    other things than just study, such as work, but I want to be able to finish a degree within a reasonable time frame, which is when I discovered the 
                    RMIT bachelor of IT. A friend of mine in a World of Warcraft guild that I raid with told me about her experience with RMIT and how she had found a 
                    job whilst still in the course; that she was studying full time but without having to do 3-4 units a semester. I mulled it over and decided it was 
                    a good choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I expect to learn about group work, because although I enjoyed my previous study experience, I didn’t really learn anything about working in groups. 
                    I want to get a job lined up for when I graduate so that I can work in a field that I enjoy, but as for the field and section of IT, I’m unsure.
                     I enjoy the coding aspect of IT, although I’m not very good at it.

                <h1>Ideal Job: Junior Graduate Software Engineer</h1>
                <p>
                    The position itself is as a junior software engineer, which is enticing as it would directly involve creating applications and APIs, 
                    augmenting current software, and database management, which would be a sizeable and challenging endeavour. It would require knowledge 
                    in Java or C#, with object-oriented programming, an understanding of Javascript and specifically the React library, web application and 
                    design, Git proficiency, and databases. Whereas I may have a novice understanding of C# and object-orientated programming, I am nowhere 
                    near the understanding required. I would also be required to gain an understanding of the rest of the requirements. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Learning these skills that I currently don’t have will be a hefty task, but through the this degree I will learn how to use Git, 
                    object-orientated programming, web design, C# and database management, however for Javascript and React, and other issues I may come across,
                     I can use external education sources, such as https://www.w3schools.com and https://www.youtube.com.

                        I am a logician INTP-T, according to http://www.16personalities.com/, meaning that I am introverted, turbulent in my decision making,
                         rely on my head over my feelings, curious by nature, and open-minded. Filled with contradictory personality traits, with lofty goals 
                         and ideas, but with the inability to follow up, accompanied with the worry of never being able to accomplish those goals. As an introverted 
                         person, it would limit my ability to socialise with other people, affecting my group work, which I know from personal experience to be problematic. 
                         I believe that in forming a team, I should attempt to pair myself with someone that can take lead and speak for me but take my input without overtly 
                         calling my input out.

                        I’m a visual/tactile learner, according to http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml, 
                        which means that I learn through working through problems physically and reaffirming the knowledge through imagery, such as flash cards. 
                        I’m easily distracted by sounds and should try to eliminate distractions to create a proper learning environment. I would have a harder 
                        time in a team environment, based off these results, if I were to be paired with someone that were more of an auditory learner, although 
                        it’s hard to judge group work off results that aren’t indicative of any answer relating to it. As for team design, I believe that, as said, 
                        I would have an easier time in a group with people that were more visual/tactile but seeing as the results are within a 5% difference, it’s 
                        almost negligible.

                        Being the big five personality test given by https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test, meaning that I have a high ability for
                         abstract thinking, low ability to self-discipline, extremely low extraversion with implied introversion, moderate agreeableness, and very
                          high neuroticism. As is the same with my Myers-Briggs test, this test shows that I am very introverted, which is a disagreeable attribute
                           for social situations. As said in my myers-briggs text, I would say that I would require some people with a more extroverted personality 
                           types, but also a lower neuroticism level, according to this test, as I believe too many neurotic people in a group would cause problems.

                <h1>Project idea:</h1>
                
                <h2>Overview </h2> 
                <p>
                    The project will be a web and mobile based application that will compare the prices of grocery items, as compared to other stores,
                     which will involve the use of a web scraper to collect all the links available. It will then scrape the data, aggregate, and clean the data.
                      This cleaned data will then be used to identify what the item is with the use of the category and name, the price of the product and whether
                       it is on sale or not, compare the price of similar products for stores around you, and show stock availability, depending on store, and then 
                       store data in some sort of database.
                </p>

                <h2>Motivation </h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone needs to buy things from the grocery store, but it is time consuming to find the best prices from every grocery store competitor. 
                    If a consumer could be given the ability to search across multiple grocery stores to find the best prices and given a distance to the store,
                     based off distance travel time data given from Google Directions API, this information would allow them to make an informed decision and 
                     evaluate what is best for them, given possible advantages due to store times, rewards, distance, and price. Although the processes of crawling, 
                     scraping, cleaning, and storing the data to be processed will take some tweaking to automate, it is feasibly possible.  
                </p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    As for features for the application, a search bar will be required to be able to search through the catalogue of items that are stored
                     in the database. The user is aided by the ability to filter through items based on store, brands, price (unit or by item), and range 
                     from store in KMs, such that it will only show stores within a certain distance of the user. At this point you can either choose a store 
                     in which you wish to shop, or in the case the user has selected the setting in their account which enables “replacement if available”, 
                     which will try to find a related item based off the name, category or type of item, and price. Upon searching for an item, if you click 
                     on that item, you will be brought to a page that will show the current price, product information such as nutritional information and weight,
                      store(s) of which stock that specific product, product reviews scraped from either the website or alternatively product review or something similar, 
                      and historical price of the item, which would allow the user to compare the price to previous prices, to ensure they’re getting the best price. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The application will use a graphical user interface to show the user the surrounding stores, depending on limiting factors, such as the store being 
                    open or not. This graphic user interface will show the total price of the shopping list on the pins, an icon of the brand of store, and depending on
                     whether the user agrees to replacement items for different stores or not will be a limiting factor for the number of stores that show up, relative 
                     to the position of the user. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Through the use of a personal account, the application will be able to keep track of who and where the user is, enabling the user to 
                    get personal notifications for product price drops via email, and get positional data through a stored home address or current location 
                    to ensure that the distance measurements from stores are correct. This allows a user to understand the distances to stores and have that
                     be part of the decision. 
                </p>  
                    
                 <p>
                    Once the user has decided which store they wish to go to, the user can click on the corresponding store pin, depending on the store, 
                    as not all stores show aisle information for products, in the case the store does give the aisle information for products, such as either 
                    Woolworths or Coles, the application will use that information to display aisle information. 
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    This aisle information will allow the user to understand in which order of aisles to go to for the store if they choose to use the application
                     to organise their shopping. It will also display other store information, such as the store address, opening and closing hours, and the phone 
                     number. The user can click onto the address, which will be used to link to their choice of map application, most likely to be Google maps, 
                     and use that as a guide to the store.
                </p>
                    


                <h2>Tools and Technologies </h2> 
                <p>
                    The website itself would most likely be a cloud-based server, as it is cheap and easy to deploy, most likely a version of linux, 
                    such as Apache HTTP Server, of which can be hosted by many sources, such as HostGator Web Hosting. An application server will be 
                    required to run the web application, which will require most commonly uses an operating system, such as Apache Tomcat. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    And the application server will most likely go along with a database server, being most likely a linux based operating system,
                     of which is most commonly MySQL. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that can be hosted by cloud servers 
                     such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure; alternatively, could be hosted by yourself, 
                     which could be cheaper.   
                </p>

                <h2>Skills Required </h2> 
                <p>For large scale deployment, it would require servers, in which would require proficiency in whatever server architecture used,
                     be it the operating system, tools or physical hardware, in the case you’re not using cloud servers. It could be required to use 
                     Python for the web crawling, data scraping, and storage of the data. Depending on the type of database management system you use, 
                     it will be likely you will need to understand PHP & SQL/MySQL for the database and the search engine required. HTTP/CSS will be required 
                     for the website, along with supporting languages, such as Java, the ability to use APIs and their associated languages, namely JavaScript. 
                </p>

                <h2>Outcome </h2>
                <p>
                    If the project is successful, the user will be able to utilise the web and or the mobile application to make an informed decision of 
                    where they want to go to get what items, based off price via historical price as compared to current price or discounted current price; and
                     store information, such as distance, store hours, and product availability. Allowing those people that choose to shop more sporadically,
                      buying less items but more frequently through a period of time, as opposed to someone that bulk buys their shopping, to possibly change 
                      the shops they go to because of the application.
